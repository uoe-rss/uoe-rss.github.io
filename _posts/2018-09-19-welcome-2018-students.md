  Introduction to the 'Robotics: Science and Systems' course for the academic year of 2018/2019.
---

This course will be a Masters degree level introduction to several core areas in robotics: kinematics and dynamics of robots; robot control, classical and modern control theories; motion planning; state estimation and signal processing; localization and mapping.

Lectures on these topics will be complemented by a large practical that exercises knowledge of a cross section of these techniques in the construction of an integrated robot in the lab, motivated by a task such as robot navigation. Also, in addition to lectures on algorithms and lab sessions, we expect that there will be several lecture hours dedicated to discussion of implementation issues - how to go from the equations to code.

The aim of the course is to present a unified view of the field, culminating in a practical involving the development of an integrated robotic system that actually embodies key elements of the major algorithmic techniques. NOTE: This is a 20 pt course, as opposed to the standard 10 pt courses since this covers two introductory topics: robotics & control and a practical element.
